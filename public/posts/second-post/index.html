As I think back to my best experiences in learning music, I find myself thinking about how lucky I have been to have had great teachers. While recent technologies have made it easier to learn things on our own, there are certain things I have learnt that I can’t imagine having found on my own (sometimes you don’t know what you’re looking for). Now that I find myself on the other side of the teaching equation, I want to replicate these positive learning experiences with my students. As a teacher I have two goals: to instil a passion for music in all my students, and to provide them with all of the tools that I have learned throughout my career as a musician in order to make myself redundant. A good lesson should leave the student inspired and excited about music.
</p>

<p>In order to nurture a deep appreciation of music I try exposing students to as much music as possible and show them how to listen to it and appreciate it. By encouraging critical thinking and teaching in frameworks and concepts rather than single solutions to problems, I hope to transfer not only my knowledge but also its structure and method of acquisition.</p>
<p>The piano at its best is just like any other tool: an instrument for its user to produce something of value (in our case—music). Playing piano has two components: learning how to use the instrument and learning what to do with it. The first is not particularly difficult to learn and is simply a case of learning how to move at the piano. The second however, is much more important. Heinrich Neuhaus describes the importance of developing what he calls ‘the artistic image’ in his book The Art of Piano Playing. What Neuhaus calls the ‘artistic image’ as I understand it, is the essence of the music, its ideal form—and takes a lot of diligent work to develop. My role as a teacher is to help my students become great musicians who can achieve their artistic vision through mastery of their instrument.</p>
<p>So what makes a great musician? As far as I can tell, all great musicians have several things in common: they have a vast and varied musical knowledge, a great ear that allows them to creatively translate that knowledge into their own vocabulary and solid technique that allows them to execute their artistic vision.</p>
<p>In aiming to become a great musician, two skills are crucial: the ability to mentally form an ‘ideal’ musical image, and the ability to solve musical problems in order to achieve that musical image. The former is developed by listening to and learning music as well as its historical context. The latter is developed through understanding the frameworks and concepts surrounding technique and theory. Ideally, we’re aiming to have a complete musical image of what we’re trying to achieve and we have the problem solving capabilities to help us get as close as possible to that image.</p>
<p>Now, learning music can only really be done one way—by learning music! By that I mean that learning repertoire is the most important vehicle to learning. Isolated concepts and ideas mean nothing if they are not contextualised. That being said, there are four pillars to my course material: repertoire, history, ear training and theory. This is how I’ve classified the different learning areas to target all of what I believe are the most important skills to have as a musician.</p>
<p>In a typical lesson, we might start with a brief catch-up on what’s happened in life in the last week. Then I’ll get my student to play their piece and we’ll talk about any problems they’re having and ways we can make the piece sound better. While studying the piece we might explore a theory concept, some history, or familiarise ourselves with a particular sound found in the piece. Over the week I’ll give my students some listening to do, maybe some melodies to learn by ear and send them off to work on the details we discussed for their piece. The specifics change depending on the style of music that I’m teaching—for classical, we’ll focus more on listening for details around phrasing, dynamics, articulation and technique to achieve those details; for jazz we might focus more on theory and improvisation concepts as well as heavier ear training. Every lesson is different and I adapt my expectations and the workload depending on the drive and motivation of the student.</p>
<p>Having a sense of progression is important in any skill based activity. By learning progressively harder pieces (both conceptually and technically), I am always aiming to challenge my students from one song to the next. While I have a core curriculum of pieces that I revolve around, I highly encourage students to listen and find pieces that they want to learn in any genre.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have found the best students have two qualities in common: a real drive to work hard, and a insatiable curiosity. I believe these traits are crucial in order to be a great learner. One needs to be curious in order to want to learn, and one needs the discipline and work ethic to do the learning.</p>
<p>While I have received my Honours degree in Jazz Performance and have left university, I am currently studying to get my ATCL diploma. I am always aiming to improve my own playing and working through different musical problems to increase my toolbox of solutions that I’m able to provide my students with. I’m still academically involved in musicology, regularly reading scholarly journals and books and writing articles for my website. I am currently looking into better ways of teaching sight-reading and working on a technique curriculum that will be integrated to a core set of repertoire.</p>
<p>Music is about more than just music. The skills you learn in a piano lesson (or any music class) are widely applicable: focus, mindfulness, patience, discipline, courage, sensitivity. As a teacher I’m basing my teaching around these core values of character and developing them through the medium of practising music.</p>
