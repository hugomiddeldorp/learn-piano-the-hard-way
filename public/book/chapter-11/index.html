be a shame. There is nothing quite like the rush, pleasure, and feeling of
accomplishment that comes from delivering a great performance. You spend all
this time working in private, building your skills, and you only keep it for
yourself, pity! As an audience member, there is nothing I love more than seeing
someone I care about strive and succeed in an artistic endeavour. You build a
closeness with people that can&rsquo;t be achieved any other way. Performing may not
be for everyone but I think you would be doing yourself a disservice if you
never gave it a fair go.</p><p>I used to dread performing. My fingers would shake so violently and be so weak
it would often cause me to make mistakes. My mind was so filled with
apprehension I would forget my music. The music I had worked so hard on
perfecting would dissolve and give way to a robotic and anxiety-filled rendition
of it.</p><p>Performance anxiety comes from the fear of failure or embarrassment.
Understanding the root of it may be useful from the point of view of overcoming
it. Without getting too psychoanalytical, the belief that we are not good
enough, or capable of performing often comes from childhood. It doesn&rsquo;t have to
be related to music; any event that leads to public failure or embarrassment can
build and strengthen that belief. To overcome this feeling, we need to prove to
ourselves that we can perform and overcome obstacles. We need to have a series
of achievements and successes in order to build the confidence needed to apply
our skills in public, when the stakes are high.</p><p>There is nothing inherently more difficult in performing in front of thousands
of people than performing by yourself at home; it is the same music, the same
physical movements. All the difference is in our head and in what we believe we
can achieve.</p><h2 id=confidence-comes-from-skill>Confidence comes from skill</h2><p>Before even thinking about performance, we need to make sure that our piece is
performance ready. Most of the time, when we learn music, we learn it until it
is good-enough, and we have learned what we wanted from it. Performance requires
us to put in extra effort to make the piece virtually error-free and
consistently great. The piece needs to be so solid and so good that you believe
there is nothing that could happen that could throw you off. Whatever happens,
you need the confidence that you will be able to deal with it. This is where you
need to understand what you are scared of, and prepare for that.</p><p>There may be sections of the piece that you sometimes forget; spend more time
with those sections:</p><ul><li>practise the section extremely slow (30% speed)</li><li>practise the section faster</li><li>practise it <a href=https://learnpianothehardway.com/book/chapter-8/#no-time>in your mind</a></li><li>play the right-hand part with the left-hand and vice versa</li><li>start on different beats and sub-beats</li><li><a href=https://learnpianothehardway.com/book/chapter-6/>understand the music</a> on a deeper level</li><li>the list goes on&mldr;</li></ul><p>If a passage doesn&rsquo;t feel secure technically, address that issue: go back to
basics, back to playing slowly and figure out good technique for it. You are not
going backwards if you slow it down again. Trying to push through is a waste of
time.<div id=sidenote class="lg:absolute lg:right-0 lg:w-80 lg:-mt-10 lg:-mr-88 leading-tight text-base mb-4 px-2 border-y-2 border-customblue-400/75 py-4 text-customblue-400/75">Trust me, I have been there many times.</div></p><p>Record yourself and get to the point where you can play the piece three times in
a row with no mistakes.</p><p>Now you are ready to perform.</p><h2 id=raise-the-stakes>Raise the stakes</h2><p>Well&mldr; First lower them, then gradually increase them. As I mentioned earlier,
we need to build the confidence we can perform and overcome obstacles. That will
not happen if we keep trying to perform in high stakes situations and falling
short of the mark. By lowering the stakes and lowering our anxiety, we can build
and gain that confidence to push us further.</p><p>Before I list the milestones you should aim gradually achieve, I want to stress
the importance of having supportive people around. You need to have people who
you care about and who care about you. You need to have people whose love and
care is not dependent on your performance. You need to be convinced that no
matter what you do when performing, their image of you will not be tainted.
Sometimes people like that can be hard to find, but if you want to build that
confidence, you will have to find them.</p><p>Here is the progression I would suggest for dealing with performance anxiety:</p><ol><li>Record a video of yourself with no intent of showing it to anyone. This is
similar to recording yourself for the purpose of review, but the intent is
different. While this is a private performance, it remains a <em>performance</em>,
treat it as such. If you make a big mistake, continue until the end. You can
re-record a different performance, but each performance should be complete.</li><li>Record a video to show to a select number of people with the explicit
instruction: positive comments only.</li><li>Record a video for a few musically educated people to give their constructive
feedback. You are not looking for suggestions for huge interpretation
changes, but rather for people to give you a fair judgement of the quality of
the performance. If the feedback is negative, it should be constructive.</li><li>Repeat steps 2-3 live, rather than with video recordings.</li><li>Grow the size of the audience to larger groups of people you know, to
eventually groups of people you don&rsquo;t know. Try to find opportunities around
your area for performances: churches, retirement homes, talk to teachers and
see if you can attend their student recitals. You could even film your
(however small) public performance and put it online for feedback.</li></ol><p>If you ever have the opportunity to perform in a group, I would recommend it.
Being in the same situation as other people, going through the same struggle
together in a supportive environment can be really beneficial. Also it eases the
anxiety knowing that the attention of the public is not all on you.</p><hr><p>Performing in public may be the most mentally challenging part of learning to
play the piano, but more than anything else, it is <em>the</em> transferable skill.
Learning to perform under pressure, and to perform well is a skill that will
transfer to all areas of your life. Use it as a medium to be uncomfortable, to
face your fears. Music is about more than practising by yourself. Share your
music, share your vision.</p></article><div class="bg-stone-200 text-stone-700 text-base font-sans rounded-md p-6">Please support this book by buying it <a href=/buy-book class=underline>here</a>.</div><div class="text-gray-600 text-base font-sans w-72 mx-auto my-4 flex justify-between gap-2"><div class=text-left><a href=https://learnpianothehardway.com/book/chapter-10/>&lt; Ear training</a></div><div class=text-center>•</div><div class=text-right><a href=https://learnpianothehardway.com/book/chapter-12/>Reference Materials ></a></div></div><div class=my-8><div class="w-80 mx-auto mb-2 font-sans text-center text-sm text-stone-400">Licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license</a></div><div class="flex gap-1 justify-center opacity-50"><img class=h-6 src=https://learnpianothehardway.com/images/cc.svg alt>
