I also believe that authors,
educators, and teachers should be compensated for their work.</p><p>It is the responsibility of us who can afford it to finance free and public
education. If you have the means to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; this book and you have gained value
from it, I would ask that you pay for the book.</p><p>There are two price points below. A basic price point at $10 NZD, and a generous
one for $20 NZD. If you wish to donate more, you can purchase the book multiple
times. You will <em>not</em> get a PDF for the book, you will <em>not</em> get any special
perks. While I would like to keep this book up on the internet forever, the
truth is that we don&rsquo;t know what the future holds. Because this book is on the
internet, it&rsquo;s not really anywhere. If you are worried about the website not
being available any more, you can download the source code for the book
completely for free at <a href=https://github.com/hugomiddeldorp/learn-piano-the-hard-way>this
URL</a>.</p><p><a href=https://buy.stripe.com/3cs7sIfBp9Ud7BefYY>Buy the book for $10 NZD</a></p><p><a href=https://buy.stripe.com/bIYeVa4WLeatcVy7st>Buy the book for $20 NZD</a></p><p>Thank you for your contribution. I hope you enjoy the contents of this book and
they prove useful to you.</p></article><div class=my-8><div class="w-80 mx-auto mb-2 font-sans text-center text-sm text-stone-400">Licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license</a></div><div class="flex gap-1 justify-center opacity-50"><img class=h-6 src=https://learnpianothehardway.com/images/cc.svg alt>
