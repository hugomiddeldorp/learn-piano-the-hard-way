I believe education should be freely available. I also believe that authors,
educators, and teachers should be compensated for their work.

It is the responsibility of us who can afford it to finance free and public
education. If you have the means to "buy" this book and you have gained value
from it, I would ask that you pay for the book.

There are two price points below. A basic price point at $10 NZD, and a generous
one for $20 NZD. If you wish to donate more, you can purchase the book multiple
times. You will *not* get a PDF for the book, you will *not* get any special
perks. While I would like to keep this book up on the internet forever, the
truth is that we don't know what the future holds. Because this book is on the
internet, it's not really anywhere. If you are worried about the website not
being available any more, you can download the source code for the book
completely for free at [this
URL](https://github.com/hugomiddeldorp/learn-piano-the-hard-way).
