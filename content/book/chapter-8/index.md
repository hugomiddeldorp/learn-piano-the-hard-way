Let's begin with the end and work our way back: we want to become a great
pianist, we have identified the requisite qualities (namely musicality and
technicality), and we have seen how to acquire them (through the integrative
approach of learning repertoire). We have the destination, we know the direction,
now we need to make the path. We need to practise.

Before I discuss how I structure my practise, I want to deal with the two most
common roadblocks people experience regarding practising.

## No time

The most common roadblock to practising piano (or anything, really) is a lack of
time. Unfortunately for us, magic necklaces that can turn back time don't exist.
Rather than fooling ourselves into thinking we have unlimited time and energy,
we need to work with the reality of our busy schedules, figure out our
priorities and set realistic expectations based on them.

Practise requires focused time, whatever your life looks like, you want to be
able to allocate at least 30 minutes where you are mentally alert and can
have uninterrupted focus. Obviously, practising every day is ideal, but if the
choice is between seven blocks of low-focus, interruption-filled 30 minute
blocks, and three high-focus 60 minute sessions, I think the 60 minute sessions
are better, even if the total time is lower. Spending any less than 2h on piano
a week will yield poor results. If you can't commit to that, you will need to
make some decisions about what you find important in life, and how piano fits
into the picture. If life gets too busy, park the piano, or understand you will
not be making a lot of progress, and come back to it with full steam later on.

You may only have time for a few hours a week at the piano, but that doesn't
mean you can't practise away from the piano. Hours spent commuting can be
transformed into hours spent practising.

As long as your commute doesn't require a lot of mental attention, you can
practise in your head. Mental practise is the invisible skill of the best
musicians. Obsessive musicians spend all their available mental space on
practising. On the bus, rather than reading a book, or listening to music, close
your eyes, and imagine yourself practising a passage you have been working on.
Imagine what the keys feel like under your fingers, imagine the sound the piano
produces as you play, imagine reading the music, or looking at your hand. The
sound of the notes should resonate in your head. Like meditation, mental
practise requires you to constantly battle mental distractions and to keep
bringing your attention back to practising. As such, don't be discouraged if you
find it almost impossible at first -- like all things, it will get better with
more practise. Mental practise isn't limited to practising repertoire. Anything
you can physically practise at the piano can be practised in your mind.

Outside of mental practise, there are many other ways to practise music away
from the piano. Below are a few examples:

- Sight-singing in your head
- Different rhythms and polyrhythms with your hands or fingers on knees
- Finger independence, and other fundamental piano technique movements
- Transcription: you could start the process of memorising the sound of a piece
  you are trying to transcribe
- Functional ear training using various apps
- etc.

## Not enough energy

You could have two hours of free time at the end of the day, but after working a
full time job, making dinner, cleaning up, and putting the kids to bed, you may
have no energy left. If you can't move your schedule around very easily, there
are still some things you can try to boost your energy for the end of the day:

- Breathing exercises
- Power nap
- Stretching and mobility
- Light work out

Those are not permanent solutions and may only give you another 30 minutes for
mental energy. After a long day, nothing other than sleep will truly restore
your energy. Try to organise your time such that you can reserve a few good
practise sessions earlier in the day throughout the week. Again, it's better to
have three high-focus practise sessions than seven low-focus ones.

## What to practise

What you choose to practise will be highly individual: it will depend on the
time you have, specific priorities, and your natural preferences. If you want to
become a great jazz pianist, you may spend more time working on improvisation
than learning Chopin Ã‰tudes. If you want to become a great session musician, you
may focus on sight-reading rather than memorising repertoire. Be careful
specialising too quickly; you want to ensure that your foundation is complete
and solid before you start building too far up.

Here is a list of the things I think everyone should practise until they get to
a satisfactory level:

- Repertoire
- Theory
- Technique
- Sight-reading
- Ear training

Hopefully, following the [Integrative Approach]({{< ref "/book/chapter-6" >}}), and practising all of the above
in the context of music.

## Three-scale planning

Personally, I structure my practice on three scales: quarterly, weekly, and
daily. Instead of having to remind myself everyday of why I am practising
something, or questioning whether it really is *the best thing* to practise
right now, I can trust that I have already done that thinking. At worst, I'll
change course in three months time.

Rather than giving abstract descriptions of this planning process, let me give
an example of what that may look like:

At the beginning of a quarter, I will make a list of the projects I want to
achieve, and the things I want to focus on and improve:

- Learn (memorise and get performance ready) the first movement of Bach's
  Partita in C minor
- Improve sight-reading
- Apply concept of rise and fall in improvisation
- Work on 5:4 polyrhythm

Then, at the beginning of every week, I will review the previous week and apply
any learnings, as well as plan the amount of time, or milestones to get closer
to the quarterly goals:

- Spend 3h sight-reading
- Memorise pages 2-3 of Bach hands separately
- Spend 5h working on rise and fall concept on: Blues for Alice and All the
  Things You Are
- Get comfortable playing 5:4 polyrhythm with hands on knees and counting out
  loud

If I don't have enough time (or energy) to work on everything every day, I will
also schedule the days when I will work on each thing. For example, I may not
have enough time to practise sight-reading every day, and so I will schedule 1h
on Mon, Wed, and Fri and I won't work on it any other days.

Finally, each day I will pick something from the weekly list, or whatever I
scheduled for that day. By the time we get to the day, there shouldn't be much
planning left to do. Remember when learning a piece to allocate time for
[analysis and investigation]({{< ref "/book/chapter-6" >}}). In reality, the work should already be set out in
front of you based on what you worked on the day before and what you are trying
to achieve by the end of the week.

Throughout the practice session, you should be taking notes and [keeping a log]({{< ref "/book/chapter-5/#keep-a-log" >}}) of
what you do. At the end of the week, when planning the next one, you can compile
the logs and learnings and use them to improve the coming week. Similarly, at
the end of the quarter, you can follow the same steps for improving the next
quarter: for example maybe you were too ambitious, and you need to adjust your
goals.

## Conclusion

Time and energy are finite resources. In order to practise well, we need to give
ourselves time to focus without distractions on getting better at playing the
piano. Remember, practising does not necessarily mean sitting at the piano, we
can also practise just as effectively away from the piano.

We should set high, but realistic expectations on what we can achieve with the
amount of time we have to practise. In that time, we should ensure to cover all
aspects of our musical development.

Work hard, make practise enjoyable, and be kind to yourself.

This marks the end of the core of this book. In the next section, we look at how
to take our music education further than simply learning the piano. I discuss
composition, improvisation, ear training, and performing.
