All musicality requires creativity. Whether you are interpreting a piece of
music written by another composer, arranging it for a different ensemble,
composing your own music, or improvising over the music of someone else, you are
involved in a creative process. Even something as trivial as creating as
exercise out of a section of music is a creative act. If you are not interested
in further pursuing creativity in music in the form of composition and
improvisation, this section may not be necessary. I would suggest, however, to
give composition and improvisation a go for two reasons: it is fun, and it is
also a great way to understand music.

I consider composition and improvisation to be two ends of the same continuum of
creating music. On one end you have time to revise, delete, and perfect the music
you are creating, on the other, you are creating music in real time with no
ability to backtrack or correct mistakes. Composition is slowed down
improvisation, and improvisation is real time composition. Practising one will
inevitably improve the other.

In the [Musicality]({{< ref "/book/chapter-2/#listening" >}}) chapter, I stressed the importance of listening and introduced
the common analogy between music and language. This analogy continues to be
useful in the context of learning to compose and improvise. Learning to compose
is akin to learning to speak. Once we have listened and absorbed enough of the
language, it is relatively effortless to combine words to construct meaning.
However, if we want to write poetry like Shakespeare, or prose like Dickens, we
are going to need to study. We need to find the composers and improvisers that
inspire us. The combination of what we find interesting in each, as well as our
personal views, ideas and opinions are what will form our unique style.

Finding the materials for studying composition of classical music will be
relatively easy: most scores are publicly available. But for most other
genres of music, you will have to listen to the music and write it down
yourself, a process called transcribing. Even if you have the score available, I
would recommend to try and transcribe the music. It will give you a deeper
understanding of what resonates with you about the music; and it also happens to
be one of the best ways to train your ear.

## Transcription

Transcription is not pedagogy-friendly. There isn't a lot of teaching to be done
on that front. You have to jump in the water, and learn to swim. Here are some
tips to make it feel like you are not drowning:

- Start by transcribing piano: the similarity of timbre will help identify the
  pitches.
- Work in small sections: in the beginning, you should pick phrases that are
  small enough that you can complete it in a single session.
- Listen to it a lot: Some teachers would even go as far as to instruct you to
  not attempt to transcribe it until you can audiate it completely (or even
  better, sing it out loud). I don't think you need to go that far for
  everything, but listen as much as you can.
- Use software to slow it down: [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is a free software you can use for that
  purpose.
- When transcribing chords, work from the outside in: the top and bottom notes
  are usually the easiest to pick out -- once you've done that, you can start
  guessing what the inner notes are.

If you are transcribing for jazz and improvisation, you should also try to play
along as soon as possible, and pay very close attention to the phrasing. For jazz
in particular, the phrasing plays a crucial role in the quality of a line, and
it shouldn't be ignored. Even if you are transcribing another instrument, try to
emulate the phrasing and the tone as much as possible.

## Analysis and application

Inspiration can lead us blindly to create mediocre copies of the musicians we
love most. By stealing -- that is -- making something our own, we are taking
control of our identity, crafting our sound with intent.

Having put in a lot of effort transcribing a piece of music, you may think the
work is now done. You would be wrong. The most important part is still to come.
Transcription is just a way to acquire the music in front of you for the
purpose of analysing it. What we want to do is extract *concepts*, not the ideas
themselves, but the means to get those ideas. We want to learn *how* to think like
our favourite composers, not *what* they thought.

Go through the section of interest and highlight any of the relevant musical
characteristics that explain why this section is appealing to you. It may be
a particular scale, or rhythm, it could be a chord voicing, or the way
that a motif is developed. I wouldn't highlight more than three or four, so that
you are able to give enough attention and detail to each.

Next, we want to turn each of these descriptions into prescriptions: prompts for
application to our own music. Application could mean anything from composing a
line (also known in jazz as a *lick*) to a whole piece, or simply improvising
with a particular rhythm in mind. You can read some of my analyses from my time
at university to give you an idea. I've also included supplementary readings and
resources if you want more concrete exercises and examples of how to apply
concepts to composition and improvisation.
